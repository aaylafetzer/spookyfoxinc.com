        <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
        <p>If you're interested in commissioning me - that's awesome! Thank you so much for supporting me. I do have a terms of service, just to keep both you and I safe. I recommend reading the following information~</p>
        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <p>Payment will be made using my paypal.me link, which I will provide to you! Work will not progress past the sketch stage of the commission until payment has been received in full.</p>
        <h2>Turnaround & Queue</h2>
        <p>My queue can be found by following this link: <a href="https://trello.com/b/mHtK9ALe/commission-progress"></a></p>
        <p>This will give you a rough idea of how long it will take me to start work on your commission - you MUST be okay with this. I do not tolerate being dmed a lot to hurry up. Do not send me messages designed to make me feel rushed. This includes messages that just send me faces, or stickers, etc designed to nudge me, for it makes me anxious. Do not ask for progress if your commission is still on the ‘to start’ queue. I also cannot really give out rough ETAs for commissions, as this can vary so much depending on my work schedule.</p>
        <p>The exception to this rule is if you request a rush commission, which incurs a fee of +50% of the original price. Depending on size, that commission has a guaranteed completion time of within 48-72 hours of being paid.</p>
        <h2>Edits</h2>
        <p>I will ONLY do large edits in the sketch phase of a commission. You will be provided with a sketch to confirm when I start work on your commission. Any large edits MUST be requested then and only then. I will not do large edits when a commission is complete; if you would really like a large scale edit once you see the final product, we can discuss a quote.*</p>
        <p>If the commission does not include a confirmation sketch (i.e. chibis, patreon sketches), you must give me any preferences for pose and expression when you request the commission. I will not be changing these things in any major way when the commission is finished.</p>
        <p>The exception to this rule is customs - I will accept more edits after the colouring and lining of a custom design commission. This does not include huge lineart changes. Minor ones are accepted.</p>
        <p>*If I genuinely get something wrong on the commission i.e. misreading the ref sheet, missing out markings, that is completely on me and I will definitely fix that for you!</p>
        <h2>Won’t draw</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I will not draw:</li>
    <li>Hateful/offensive themes</li>
    <li>People</li>
    <li>Racist/misogynistic/transphobic content</li>
</ul>
        <p>Please note this is relatively fluid, and I will simply not take commissions which I consider to be offensive or cruel to any party. I also do not draw for nazifurs or people who sexualise minors/real animals (inc. nsfw babyfurs).</p>
        <h2>NSFW</h2>
        <p>If you want to buy nsfw off of me, you MUST BE ABLE TO PROVE YOU ARE 18+! I will ask for ID. I know this is a hassle, but I will not risk drawing porn for a minor.</p>
        <p>I also will not draw certain types of nsfw, namely:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scat</li>
            <li>Inflation</li>
            <li>Cub</li>
            <li>Extreme fetish</li>
            <li>Feral</li>
            <li> Extreme noncon</li>
            <li> Babyfur</li>
            <li> Beastility/feral porn</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Among some others, either because I don’t think my style would work for it, or for other reasons. If you’re not sure, ask! I really don’t mind! :)</p>
        <h2>Posting the image elsewhere</h2>
        <p>Once the commission is complete you can do what you want with it, but sharing with credit is always appreciated, and do not claim it as your own!
        <p>Thank you so much for considering me, and I hope all this works for you! If you have any other questions, please feel free to dm me on telegram: @spookyfoxinc
